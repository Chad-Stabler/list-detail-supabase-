## The Golden Rule: 

🦸 🦸‍♂️ `Stop starting and start finishing.` 🏁

If you work on more than one feature at a time, you are guaranteed to multiply your bugs and your anxiety.

## Making a plan

1: import render function from list/detail work and import data into new supabase project.
2: build home page to display(also copyable from list/detail) data from supabase.
3: functionality/build should be simialar to list/detail all around except for building in supabase instead of data folder
- Ask: should any of this work be abstracted into functions? (i.e., is the work complicated? can it be resused?)
